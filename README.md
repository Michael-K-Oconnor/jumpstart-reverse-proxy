# Jumpstart Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy service powered by NGINX for Jumpstart, a mockup crowdfunding application based off of KickStarter

## Motivation

Jumpstart is a full stack web application that serves as a sandbox for personal exploration of different software development techniques and practices. This application has a microservice architecture with three services, one to serve React.js client-side code and two seperate Node.js backend services handling API requests with an NGINX reverse-proxy routing incoming requests.

## Installation and Setup

There are several ways to run this reverse proxy.

1. Download it from the Docker image michaelkoconnor/jumpstart-reverse-proxy hosted on DockerHub [here](https://cloud.docker.com/u/michaelkoconnor/repository/docker/michaelkoconnor/jumpstart-reverse-proxy) 

2. Clone this repository and build the Docker image locally using the included Dockerfile

3. Clone the [jumpstart-main repository](https://github.com/Michael-K-Oconnor/jumpstart-main.git) and run the following command to initialize all containers required to run the Jumpstart app locally. Note that several of the containers included in the docker-compose file require .env files which are not currently publically available

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Built With

- Docker
- NGINX
